            <h2>Videogames</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite things about myself is that I’m a nerd. I collect figurines, I keep up with the latest news on the various superhero universes, I love to read non-fiction books about various subjects, and – most importantly – I love video games. </p>
        
            <p>Today, I’m currently playing Persona 5 Golden, Black Myth: Wukong and Marvel Rivals. In my past time, I like to have a good mix of a RPGs with MOBAs going so that I can oscillate depending on the mood that I am currently in.  Additionally, I can appreciate the different communities that are built around the video games themselves: other gamers livestreaming their play, commentary from the video game community on their perspectives of the craft of the game, etc. I find video games to be a nice escape to jump into another world and imagine you’re able to do the impossible. </p>
